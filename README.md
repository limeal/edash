# Modules Informations extractor from epitech website

This project aim to produce a more intelligent way to see the modules proposed by epitech for the year 2024.
To work this project depends on two factors:

1. An extractor because epitech doesn't have a conveniant api we need to extract by using data mining in my case in
python using playwright

2. A frontend to display the value extracted
